# AFFilterList

#### A Filtering List for SwiftUI

- [ ] Would like text be hidden then show when screen pulled down slight as in the Setting menu on iPhone

## Usage

You need a collection of `Identifiable` data for computing the list. The `filterKeys` need to `String` but you can choose which field(s) you want to filter on.

The default placeholder is "Search" however you can change that in call.

The default SF Symbol is "magnifyingglass" however you can put any SF Symbol 

If you want text only to show then make `systemImage: nil`

## Example 

Here is a simple example code:

```swift
import AFFilterList
import SwiftUI

struct ContentView: View {
    let data = Bundle.main.decode([Cab].self, from: "Cab.json")

    var body: some View {
        NavigationView {
            FilterList(data, filterKeys: \.title) {
                Text($0.title)
            }
            .navigationTitle("Title")
        }
        .listStyle(PlainListStyle())
    }
}
```

Change the PlaceHolder

import SwiftUI

struct ContentView: View {
    let data = Bundle.main.decode([Cab].self, from: "Cab.json")

    var body: some View {
        NavigationView {
            FilterList(data, filterKeys: \.title, placeholder: "Enter Title",systemImage: nil) {
                Text($0.title)
            }
            .navigationTitle("Title")
        }
        .listStyle(PlainListStyle())
    }
}
```
